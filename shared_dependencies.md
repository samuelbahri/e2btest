1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will link to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files for styling. It will contain various DOM elements with unique id names that can be targeted by JavaScript functions (if any are added in the future).

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that correspond to those in the "index.html" file. It will also import the "tailwind.css" file to use Tailwind CSS classes.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be imported into the "styles.css" file and its classes will be used in the "index.html" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file that can be targeted by CSS for styling. They are shared between the "index.html" and "styles.css" files.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for styling rules in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. They are shared between the "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css" files.

3. CSS Import: The "tailwind.css" file is imported into the "styles.css" file, making it a shared dependency.

4. Link to CSS files: The "index.html" file will have links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, making them shared dependencies.
